The applications require:
* The latest Android 2.3 SDK
* Ant 1.8 (if you are using ant)

Most projects depend on the OI Distribution Library,
which is located in trunk/distribution/DistributionLibrary.

Using Eclipse:
* import the application and
  trunk/distrubution/DistributionLibrary
* open both projects
* launch the application.

Using Ant:
* launch build.xml
* the OI Distribution Library is included automatically.
