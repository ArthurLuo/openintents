Compatibility Libraries for Android.

This is a slight modification of Android's Support4Demos sample application, but
adapted to use v2.

The code is based on "Android Compatibility package, revision 3".
The corresponding source code can be found in the SDK in
extras/android/compatibility/v4.

The only modification was to replace all occurrences of "v4" by "v2",
and all occurrences of "4" by "2" where it refers to the API level.
