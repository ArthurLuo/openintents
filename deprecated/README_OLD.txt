The applications require:

* The latest Android 2.3 SDK

which is located in trunk/distribution/DistributionLibrary.


Using Eclipse:
==============

* import the application and
  trunk/distribution/DistributionLibrary
  (and if applicable further required library projects)

* open all projects

* launch the application.


Using Ant:
==========

* launch build.xml

* the OI Distribution Library is included automatically.
